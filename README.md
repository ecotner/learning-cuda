Learning GPU programming with CUDA

## Some resources:
* Tutorials:
    * [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cuda/index.htm) introduction to CUDA
    * [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/parallel-computing-cuda/table-of-contents) introduction to CUDA
    * NVIDIA [blog post](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/)
    * [Presentation](https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/116711/sc11-cuda-c-basics.pdf) on CUDA C/C++ basics
* [CUDA By Example](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-example)
  * apparently a good book; NOT free
* [Accelerated libraries](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries) for common operations
  * linear algebra, FFT, RNG, algebraeic equations, sparse matrices, tensor ops, linear solvers, graph algorithms
  * check this out before rolling your own algos!
* [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust)
  * high-level library of parallel algorithms and data structures
